# D&D Companion

Helps you play D&D

Sam's Notes:
> I have some ideas for the CharacterEditor and how it'll play with the Character class, I'm gonna draw up an idea and send it to you

> TestChars can be used to see what a character might look like when saved as .char files. All .char files will look the same unless it is a subrace of another race, a human, or a dragonborn, in which the first subitem under race is subrace, ethnicity, or ancestry, respectively.

Nick's Notes:
> I need to remove a few items from the editor since they're now in the Race/Class classes. 
> We should be able to start save/load and setting up the menu items once we have subraces set up.
